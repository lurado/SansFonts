## A WebKit Content Blocker That Kills Web Fonts With Fire

See [my blog post](https://jlnr.de/2015/09/13/sans-fonts.html) for the motivation behind this project.

## Download

My iOS 9 app has not passed Apple’s review yet.
If you are on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) or later, you can download the code-signed Safari extensions on [the releases page](https://github.com/jlnr/SansFonts/releases).

## Maturity

The [blocker list](content-blocker/blockerList.json) is still very basic.
I expect the list to grow as soon as I upgrade my work partition to El Capitan.
